# VHDL

As part of my coursework at Toronto Metropoliton University, my partner and I completed several design projects to implement VDHL code on an FPGA Board (Cyclone- II EP2C35F672C6) in Quartus II. 
- <b>[ASU](https://github.com/aronnod/VHDL/tree/ASU) </b>
  - Designed and implemented a 4-bit Adder/Subtractor Unit (ASU)
  - Created a Combinational Circuit that takes the decoded output of the ASU. This circuit was specifically designed to output individual digits of the Student Identification number.
  - The output of the designed circuit was visually represented on a 7-Segment display

- <b>[Combinational Circuits](https://github.com/aronnod/VHDL/tree/Combinational-Circuits) </b>
  - Designed and implemented several key digital logic components, such as: 4-to-1 Multiplexer, 2-to-4 Binary Decoder, 4-to-2 Priority Encoder, 3 to 8 Decoder with Block Schematic
  - The output of the designed circuit was visually represented on a 7-Segment display

- <b>[Johnson Counter](https://github.com/aronnod/VHDL/tree/Johnson-Counter) </b>
  - Designed and implemented a Johnson Counter, a specialized ring counter with a distinctive cycling pattern, to efficiently traverse through different states. This circuit was specifically designed to output individual digits of the Student Identification number.
  - The output of the designed circuit was visually represented on a 7-Segment display
